## CQRS and MediatR in ASP.NET Core - Building Scalable Systems

**CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** is a software architectural pattern that separates the read and write operations of a system into two distinct parts.

**Key Concepts of CQRS**:
Write Operations (Commands) and Read Operations (Queries) are handled separately.
Different models are optimized for each type of operation.
This separation can lead to simpler and more scalable architectures, especially in complex systems where the read and write patterns differ significantly.
