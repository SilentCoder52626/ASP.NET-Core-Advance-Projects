# CQRS and MediatR in ASP.NET Core - Building Scalable Systems

**CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** is a software architectural pattern that separates the read and write operations of a system into two distinct parts.

✅ Commands: Modify data (Create, Update, Delete)

✅ Queries: Retrieve data (Read operations)

This separation enhances scalability, performance, and maintainability.

**Benefits of CQRS**

✔️ Better scalability and performance

✔️ Cleaner and more maintainable code

✔️ Allows independent optimization of read and write operations

✔️ Works well with Event Sourcing and Microservices

**What is MediatR?**

MediatR is a lightweight in-process messaging library that helps decouple components in ASP.NET Core applications. It enables communication between components without direct dependencies using the Mediator pattern.

**Why Use MediatR?**

✔️ Reduces direct dependencies between layers

✔️ Simplifies unit testing by eliminating direct service dependencies

✔️ Improves maintainability and scalability


**Install Required NuGet Packages**
 ```
dotnet add package MediatR
```

# Structured Logging with Serilog in ASP.NET Core
Logging is an essential part of any application for debugging, monitoring, and tracking issues. In .NET Core, Serilog is a popular structured logging library that provides powerful features like log enrichment, various sinks (file, console, database), and JSON-formatted logs.
Why Use Serilog?

✔️ Supports structured logging (JSON format).

✔️ Multiple sinks (console, file, database, cloud, etc.).

✔️ Easy integration with .NET Core.

✔️ Enrichment features like MachineName, ThreadId, and RequestId.

 **Install Required NuGet Packages**
 ```
dotnet add package Serilog.AspNetCore
dotnet add package Serilog.Sinks.Console
dotnet add package Serilog.Sinks.File
dotnet add package Serilog.Formatting.Compact
```
**Program.cs**
```
Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
    .ReadFrom.Configuration(builder.Configuration)
    .CreateLogger();

builder.Host.UseSerilog();


app.UseSerilogRequestLogging();

```
**Appsetting.json**
``` json

  "Serilog": {
    "MinimumLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Override": {
        "Microsoft": "Warning",
        "Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Diagnostics": "Error",
        "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
      }
    },

    "WriteTo": [
      {
        "Name": "File",
        "Args": {
          "path": "logs/log.json",
          "rollingInterval": "Day",
          "rollOnFileSizeLimit": true,
          "formatter": "Serilog.Formatting.Compact.CompactJsonFormatter, Serilog.Formatting.Compact"
        }
      }
    ],
    "Enrich": [
      "WithMachineName",
      "WithProcessId",
      "WithThreadId"
    ]
  },
```

Serilog makes logging in .NET Core applications easy and powerful. With structured logging and multiple sinks, you can effectively monitor and debug your application. Try integrating Serilog with Seq, Elasticsearch, or Application Insights for even better log management!

🔹 Happy Logging with Serilog! 🚀

# Global Exception Handling in .NET

Global exception handling ensures applications remain stable by managing unexpected errors efficiently.

**Importance**

✔️ Prevents Crashes: Avoids application failures due to unhandled exceptions.

✔️ Improves Debugging: Facilitates logging for troubleshooting.

✔️ Enhances User Experience: Provides friendly error messages.

✔️ Centralized Handling: Reduces redundant error-handling code.

**Old Method (Pre .NET 6)**

✔️ AppDomain.UnhandledException: For console apps.

✔️ Application_Error in Global.asax: For ASP.NET MVC.

✔️ Middleware-based Handling: Custom middleware in .NET Core.

**New Method (Since .NET 6)**

✔️ Built-in Exception Middleware: Centralized handling.

✔️ UseExceptionHandler: Simplified global error capture.

✔️ Minimal APIs Integration: Clean, efficient error handling.

.NET's newer global exception handling methods simplify error management, enhance maintainability, and improve debugging. Implementing it ensures a robust and user-friendly application.
